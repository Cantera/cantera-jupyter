# cantera-jupyter

[Cantera](https://cantera.org) examples in the form of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org)
notebooks. To see the rendered notebooks, browse the directories above or visit the
links in the list of examples below.

**Existing Cantera users**: If you have [Cantera](https://cantera.org) and
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) installed on your local machine, simply download
any Jupyter notebook and you should be able to run it.

**New Cantera Users**: If you don't have an exiting Cantera installation, you
can either
[download and install Cantera](https://cantera.org/install/index.html)
or give Cantera a test drive in the cloud. Click on the Binder link below to
launch an interactive environment where you can run these examples. For this,
there is no installation required.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I use Cantera with Python?**

An introduction to the Cantera Python interface is available
[here](https://cantera.org/tutorials/python-tutorial.html). For more
advanced uses of Cantera, the complete documentation can be found
[here](https://cantera.org/documentation/index.html).

**Can I forgo installing Cantera locally and just use Cantera in the cloud every
time?**

The problem with using Cantera with Binder is that there is no way for you to
save your work. You can upload/download files in a session, but once the session
is over (you close your browser window), you lose all your work. You thus cannot
save your modified Jupyter notebooks.

**I still can't figure something out. Who do I ask?**

If you have more questions, need help with something, or have any suggestions,
