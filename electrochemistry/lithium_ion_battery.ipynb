    "### Kinetic equilibrium calculations\n",
    "In the kinetic equilibrium problem, steady state is achieved when the faradaic current at each electrode (anode and cathode) surface and the ionic current through the electrolyte are all zero.  There are, essentially, four relevant electric potentials which must be determined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\phi_{\\rm anode}$: electric potential of graphite anode.\n",
    "- $\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\, anode}$: electric potential of electrolyte at anode interface.\n",
    "- $\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\, cathode}$: electric potential of electrolyte at cathode interface.\n",
    "- $\\phi_{\\rm cathode}$: electric potential of LCO cathode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting one of these four to the reference potential of zero (because it is the difference in electric potential which drives currents, the actual potential values are irrelevant. Let's assume the anode electric potential is zero), there is only one distribution of electric potentials across the cell such that the current is invariant across the cell.  I.e. we want the potentials such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "i_{\\rm Far,\\, anode} = i_{\\rm ionic} = i_{\\rm Far,\\,cathode}= i_{\\rm app}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i_{\\rm app}$ is the user input for the applied current.  For this example, we assume an applied current of 0, to calculate the equilibrium voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Faradaic current\n",
    "The Faradaic current for this model is calculated using Butler-Volmer kinetics.  For a Li-ion battery, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "i = S_{\\rm elde}i_\\circ\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{F\\beta\\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F(1-\\beta)\\eta}{RT}\\right) \\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S_{\\rm elde}$ is the specific surface area of the electrode in question, $F$ is Faraday's constant, $\\beta$ is the charge-transfer symmetry parameter, $R$ the universal gas constant, $T$ the temperature, and $\\eta$ the overpotential, which is the electric potential difference between the electrode and electrolyte, $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_{\\rm elde} - \\phi_{\\rm elyte}$, relative to that at equilibrium, $\\Delta \\phi_{\\rm eq}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\eta = \\Delta \\phi - \\Delta \\phi_{\\rm eq}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "$i_\\circ$ is known as the \"exchange current density,\" which is equal to the rate of the forward and reverse current at equilibrium (which are equal).  $i_\\circ$ and $\\beta$ are provided as user inputs in the cti file.  At any particular state, (user-specified electric potentials, pressure, temperature, and chemical compositions), Cantera calculates $\\eta$ as part of the routine to evaluate reaction rates of progress $\\left(\\dot{q} = \\frac{i_{\\rm Far}}{F}\\right)$. The user simply sets the state values mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ionic current\n",
    "The electrolyte is modeled as a resistor with user-defined ionic resistance $R_{\\rm io}$, and hence the ionic current is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "i_{\\rm ionic} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,ca} - \\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,an}}{R_{\\rm io}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where positive current is defined as delivering Li$^+$ to the anode interface.  Given $i_{\\rm app}$, this equation can be inverted, to calculate the electric potential of the electrolyte at the cathode interface, relative to that at the anode interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,ca} = \\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,an} + R_{\\rm io}i_{\\rm app} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Again: in this example, $i_{\\rm app} = 0$ and hence the two electric potential values in the electrolyte are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerical routine\n",
    "For the kinetic routine, there are three processes to determine the cell voltage $\\phi_{\\rm cathode} - \\phi_{\\rm anode}$ which corresponds to the user-provided $i_{\\rm app}$:\n",
    "1. Determine the $\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,anode}$ value which corresponds to $i_{\\rm app}$, given $X_{\\rm Li, anode}$, the percentage of Li in the anode active material.\n",
    "2. Determine $\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,cathode}$, given $\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,anode}$ and $i_{\\rm app}$.\n",
    "3. Determine the $\\phi_{\\rm cathode}$ which corresponds to $i_{\\rm app}$, given $\\phi_{\\rm elyte,\\,cathode}$ and $X_{\\rm Li, anode}$, the percentage of Li in the anode active material.\n",
