    "## Ignition delay time computations in a high-pressure reflected shock tube reactor\n",
    " \n",
    "In this example we will illustrate how to setup and use a constant volume, adiabatic reactor to simulate reflected shock tube experiments. This reactor will then be used to compute the ignition delay of a gas at any temperature and pressure.  The example very explicitly follows the form set in batch_reactor_ignition_delay_NTC.pynb, which does very similar calculations, but with an IdealGasReactor.  All credit is due to the developer of that example.  This example generalizes that work to use a Reactor with no pre-assumed EoS.  One can also run ideal gas phases through this simulation, simply by specifying a cti file with that thermodynamic EoS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than the typical Cantera dependencies, plotting functions require that you have matplotlib installed, and data storing and analysis requires pandas. See https://matplotlib.org/ and http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html, respectively, for additional info.\n",
