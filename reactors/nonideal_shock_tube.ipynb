    "# Non-Ideal Shock Tube Example\n",
    "In this example we will illustrate how to setup and use a constant volume, adiabatic reactor to simulate reflected shock tube experiments. This reactor will then be used to compute the ignition delay of a gas at any temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example very explicitly follows the form set in `batch_reactor_ignition_delay_NTC.pynb`, which does very similar calculations, but with an `IdealGasReactor`. This example generalizes that work to use a `Reactor` with no pre-assumed EoS. One can also run ideal gas phases through this simulation, simply by specifying an input file with that thermodynamic EoS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than the typical Cantera dependencies, plotting functions require that you have matplotlib installed, and data storing and analysis requires pandas. See https://matplotlib.org/ and https://pandas.pydata.org/index.html, respectively, for additional info.\n",

    "The example here demonstrates the calculations carried out by G. Kogekar, et al., \"Impact of non-ideal behavior on ignition delay and chemical kinetics in high-pressure shock tube reactors,\" Combust. Flame., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2017.10.014\n",
